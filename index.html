        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The study of the universe and its origins is a profound and expansive field that covers not just the cosmos but also our understanding of Earth’s place within it. Over time, models, theories, and laws about the universe have evolved, shaped by new discoveries and advancements in technology. This guide will explore the features and origins of the universe, the evolution of scientific thought on these topics, and how this knowledge impacts our understanding of global geological activity and modern issues.

    <section id="structure">
        <h2>Changing Ideas about the Structure of the Universe</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Early Models of the Universe</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Geocentric Model:</strong> Ancient civilizations, including the Greeks, believed in a geocentric model where Earth was the center of the universe, with the sun, moon, stars, and planets revolving around it. Ptolemy (2nd century AD) famously developed a sophisticated version of this model.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Heliocentric Model:</strong> In the 16th century, Nicolaus Copernicus proposed the heliocentric model, which placed the Sun at the center of the universe with Earth and other planets orbiting around it. This idea was revolutionary and faced significant opposition from religious authorities.
        </p>
        <div class="image-placeholder">https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR7eykECrg5NkFwx52nVQwUUqy_svoQjDOVWR8P_9VCuRUoa-fh_fhtz64n&s=10</div>

        <h3>1.2 The Evolution of Modern Cosmology</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Galileo and the Telescope:</strong> Galileo Galilei’s use of the telescope in the early 17th century provided empirical evidence supporting the heliocentric model, such as observing moons orbiting Jupiter and the phases of Venus.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Newton's Laws of Motion and Universal Gravitation:</strong> Sir Isaac Newton’s work in the late 17th century explained planetary motion through his laws of motion and universal gravitation, providing a robust mathematical framework that supported the heliocentric model.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The Big Bang Theory:</strong> The modern understanding of the universe’s origins is based on the Big Bang theory, which posits that the universe began as an extremely hot and dense point around 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. This theory is supported by key evidence such as the cosmic microwave background radiation and the redshift of galaxies.
        </p>
        <div class="image-placeholder">[Telescope Image]</div>

        <h3>1.3 Refinement of Scientific Theories</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity:</strong> Albert Einstein’s theory, published in 1915, revolutionized our understanding of gravity and the structure of the universe, predicting phenomena such as the bending of light by gravity and the expansion of the universe.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Dark Matter and Dark Energy:</strong> In the late 20th century, astronomers discovered that visible matter cannot account for the total mass in the universe, leading to the concepts of dark matter and dark energy, which make up most of the universe’s mass-energy content.

    <section id="features">
        <h2>Features of the Universe</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Galaxies, Stars, and Planets</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Galaxies:</strong> The universe contains billions of galaxies, vast collections of stars, planets, and other matter held together by gravity. The Milky Way is our home galaxy.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Stars:</strong> Stars are massive, luminous spheres of plasma. Their life cycles, from birth in stellar nurseries to death as white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes, play a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Planets and Exoplanets:</strong> Planets, including Earth, orbit stars. The discovery of exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) has expanded our understanding of planetary systems and the potential for life elsewhere in the universe.
        </p>
        <div class="image-placeholder">[Galaxy Image]</div>

        <h3>2.2 The Solar System</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> The solar system consists of the Sun, eight planets, their moons, dwarf planets, and countless smaller bodies such as asteroids and comets.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Earth’s Place:</strong> Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known place in the universe that supports life. Its unique conditions—such as liquid water, an atmosphere, and a magnetic field—make it habitable.
        </p>
        <div class="image-placeholder">[Solar System Image]</div>

        <h3>2.3 The Expanding Universe</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Hubble’s Law:</strong> Edwin Hubble observed that galaxies are moving away from us, with more distant galaxies moving faster, leading to the conclusion that the universe is expanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation:</strong> This is the afterglow of the Big Bang, a faint radiation that fills the universe and provides a snapshot of the early universe.
        </p>
        <div class="image-placeholder">[Hubble's Law Image]</div>

    <section id="geological">
        <h2>Global Patterns of Geological Activity</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Plate Tectonics</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Theory of Plate Tectonics:</strong> This theory explains the movement of Earth’s lithospheric plates and accounts for global patterns of earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain building, and ocean trench formation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Impact on Earth's Surface:</strong> The movement of tectonic plates leads to the creation and destruction of landforms, influencing global geography and ecosystems.
        </p>
        <div class="image-placeholder">[Plate Tectonics Image]</div>

        <h3>3.2 Interactions Involving Global Systems</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Atmospheric and Oceanic Circulation:</strong> These systems regulate climate by distributing heat around the planet, influencing weather patterns and climate zones.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Carbon Cycle:</strong> The carbon cycle involves the movement of carbon between the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, have disrupted this cycle, contributing to climate change.
        </p>
        <div class="image-placeholder">[Global Systems Image]</div>

    <section id="issues">
        <h2>Contemporary Issues Informed by Scientific Knowledge</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Climate Change</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Global Warming:</strong> The increase in Earth’s average temperature due to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Impact on Global Systems:</strong> Climate change affects weather patterns, sea levels, and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, posing significant challenges to ecosystems, human health, and economies.
        </p>
        <div class="image-placeholder">[Climate Change Image]</div>

        <h3>4.2 Environmental Sustainability</h3>
